This is the first time I have done this, hacking someone else's code and released it in the wild. 
We are all standing on the shoulders of giants and I am very thankful to http://www.joeswebtools.com/wordpress-plugins/fun-facts/ for making this very handy and functional code.  
If I am violating any rules, sorry.  Let me know at mcdwayne.com 
I am not making any $ on this, this was for fun and learning.Ë‡
